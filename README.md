##  State Management Overview

* **Redux Toolkit** manages two main slices:

  * `taskSlice`: Handles adding, updating, deleting, filtering, and completing tasks.
  * `userSlice`: Handles adding, updating, and deleting users.
* **Redux Persist** automatically saves the Redux state to **localStorage**, so when you refresh the page, your tasks and users won’t disappear.

---

###  Redux Store Example

```tsx
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    todo: persistedTaskReducer,
    user: persistedUserReducer,
  },
});
```

###  Persist Store Example

```tsx
<PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
</PersistGate>
```

##  Routing Overview

This project uses **React Router DOM v6** to handle navigation.

| Route Path | Page      | Description                |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| `/`        | Task Page | Displays and manages tasks |
| `/task`    | Task Page | Same as the homepage       |
| `/user`    | User Page | Displays and manages users |

---
